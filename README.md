# **Pinterest Clone** 📌
This is a Pinterest clone project created using MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, and Tailwind CSS in EJS. It is my first backend project, so the main focus is on backend functionality such as authentication, uploading posts, and changing profiles. The frontend is not highly responsive.

# **Features** ✨
- User authentication (sign up, login, logout) 🔒
- Uploading posts with images and descriptions 🖼️
- Profile management (change profile details) 👤
- Basic post feed display 📃

# **Technologies Used** ⚙️
- **MongoDB**: For database management 📊
- **Express.js**: For server-side logic 🖥️
- **Node.js**: For backend runtime environment 🚀
- **Tailwind CSS**: For basic styling 🎨
- **EJS**: For templating engine 🛠️
